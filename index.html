    <h1>About me</h1>
  </header>
  <main>
    <p> My name is Diontre but you can call me Tre. I am currently living in San antonio, Texas. I have only been here 6
      months but San Antonio isn't all that new to me being I spent 5 years just three hours up the road at FT Hood,
      Texas. I was stationed in the army there. I've done online school for many years and currently about 6 classes off
      a BA in Information Technology in Business. Guess I should finish that soon, ha! I have spent the last 9 years
      working in the IT industry ranging in many different roles. I've taken on the challenges of help desk, working at
      a smaller company as the only System administrator and working with a team of engineers in security field. Oddly
      enough I went into IT wanting to do networking and obtained a CCNA but I've never had a networking position. I
      have two beautiful daughters at the age of 10 and 2. Now I am currently attending Code Fellows to create a coding
      foundation to build off my new career in. My only goal is growth, that will lead me exactly where I need to be.
